# Assignment 1

The purpose of this project is to use C# to get well known with many of the basics of the language.

## Description

In this project I made a basic rpg system. The system contains a Hero class which holds most of the functionality.
The hero class is the parent to four different classes: mage,ranger,rogue and warrior.
All these classes have unique attributes, valid weapon types, valid armor types and damage calculations.
An item class is also implemented which is the parent to the weapon and armor classes. These classes have unique names, required levels and slots.
The armor atributes and weapon damage is both randomized
